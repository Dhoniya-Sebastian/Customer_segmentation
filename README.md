## Project Overview
In this project, we aim to understand the different types of customers a business might have. By analyzing a dataset, we can group customers into segments based on their behaviors and characteristics. This helps businesses tailor their marketing strategies to better meet the needs of each segment.

### Key Concepts:
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Unlike supervised learning, which uses labeled data, unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data. The goal is to find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in the input data.
- **Customer Segmentation**: This is the process of dividing customers into groups based on common characteristics. It helps businesses target their audience more effectively.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: PCA is a technique used to reduce the dimensionality of large datasets while retaining most of the variance in the data. This makes it easier to visualize and analyze.
- **Clustering Algorithms**: These algorithms group similar data points together. In this project, we use K-Means and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) to identify distinct customer segments.

## Installation
To run this project, you will need the following libraries and dependencies:
- Python 3.6+
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

You can install the required libraries using `pip`:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/customer_segments.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd customer_segments
   ```
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Open and run the `customer_segments.ipynb` notebook.

## Files
- `customer_segments.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the project code and analysis.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset used for the analysis.

## Results
The project demonstrates the following:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming the data to make it suitable for analysis. This includes handling missing values, scaling features, and normalizing the data.
- **Dimensionality Reduction with PCA**: Reducing the number of features in the dataset while preserving important information. This helps in better visualization and faster computation.
- **Clustering**: Using K-Means and GMM to group customers into segments. These algorithms help identify customers with similar behaviors and characteristics.
- **Visualization and Interpretation**: Creating visual representations of the customer segments and interpreting what each segment represents. This helps businesses understand their customer base better.
